crop stages are five : 1:"initial", 2: "crop development", 3: "mid season", 4: "late season", 5:"ready to harvest"


stratergies:
	 Critical growth approach
	 Soil moisture depletion approach


Given a model:
	you simulate it for one day
	upload data in db
	get new data
	get new model
	simulate
	





IDEAS:

crop production as logistic function of water provided ?

Need to model farm/ farmers?
- it is a social construct.  farms would be differentiated in terms of 
knowledge and resources available. Further decision making.
more thoughts needed

water requirement (WR) includes losses during the application of irrigation water to field is ignored
similary water losses during transporatation of water is ignored



Questions:
	How will farm raise its water request to dam.
	- currently, it call supply object in Model.
	 In long run I plan to create an demand Object. and dump this info in it.
	 then optimize supply source to demand points. by some algo. 
	 
	policy is one, strategies are multiple. I need to model strategies. right?
	why I need to model National water agency then?
