				IRRIGATION MANAGEMENT System

Technology:
	An agent based model to simulate decision making by multi agents in an environment
	resulting in an emergent phenomena	

Abstract :
	Evaluate different strategies, implementable by waterbody, 
	to supply constraint water to various agricultural farms
	in an specified area with a variety of crop mixes,
	allowing stakeholders to visualize the impact of their decisions
	and optimize, 
	resutling in optimum resource production (biomass, foodGrains)
	 and economic growth
